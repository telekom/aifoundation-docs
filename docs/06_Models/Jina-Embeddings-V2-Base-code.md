## 📝 Description

Jina-Embeddings-V2-Base-code is a multilingual embedding model developed by Jina AI, designed to understand and generate embeddings for both English and 30 widely used programming languages. It supports sequence lengths of up to 8,192 tokens, making it particularly effective for processing long code snippets and technical documents. The model is based on the JinaBERT architecture, incorporating a symmetric bidirectional variant of ALiBi to manage longer sequences efficiently. Initially pre-trained on the GitHub code dataset, it was further refined using over 150 million coding question-answer pairs and docstring-source code pairs collected by Jina AI. This extensive training enables the model to excel in tasks such as code search, code review, static analysis, and documentation assistance. Notably, it does not support fine-tuning.

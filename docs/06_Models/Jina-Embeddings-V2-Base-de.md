## 📝 Description

Jina-Embeddings-V2-Base-de is a bilingual text embedding model developed by Jina AI, supporting both German and English languages. It is designed to generate 768-dimensional dense vector representations for text inputs, facilitating tasks such as semantic search, text classification, and clustering. The model is based on the JinaBERT architecture, incorporating a symmetric bidirectional variant of ALiBi to handle longer sequences effectively. With a context window of up to 8,192 tokens, it is particularly suited for processing long documents without performance degradation. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset to ensure robust performance across various applications. Notably, it does not support fine-tuning.

## 📝 Description

The BCE Reranker is a cross-encoder model developed by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) for reranking tasks in information retrieval systems. Unlike embedding models that generate vector representations, rerankers like the BCE Reranker evaluate the relevance between a query and a document pair, directly outputting a similarity score. This approach enhances the accuracy of search results by reordering documents retrieved by simpler models. The BCE Reranker supports a context window of up to 512 tokens and is optimized for multilingual applications, particularly in Chinese and English. It is designed to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. Notably, this model does not support fine-tuning. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
